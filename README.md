From Quality Control (QC) to phylogenetic Tree

This repository contains the command lines used in my thesis on viral metagenomics.
There are two extra codes written in R that I used to plot the abundance graphs of the results. The "tree.R" file is about the phylogenetic tree, which means the final step of this repository, however, is simpler, and friedly-user, to use [FigTree](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/), therefore, this file contains only one example of the ggtree library.
